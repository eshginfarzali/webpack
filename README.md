## Run

* Open `index.html` in browser (latest Google Chrome is recommended)

- Create and switch to the events-task branch.
- Ensure index.html is opened on your local machine in the browser.
- Navigate to EPAM JavaScript Advanced project in Figma. All the assets can be downloaded from it and all font sizes, margins, paddings, and text content can be found there. You might come across some dimensions that are not rounded (31px, 149px, etc.). Feel free to replace them with the closest round numbers (30px, 150px, etc.).
- In the project, while being in the events-task, create the Join Our Program section using only JavaScript DOM API. In order to do that, create a JavaScript file called main.js and include it in the <head> tag of the index.html file. The Join Our Program section should be implemented according to the materials from Figma.
- Display the Join Our Program section when the page is loaded, which means that it should be dynamically created (the previous step) and added to the page. It is mandatory to use the browser event learned in the eventâ€™s topic.
- Add an event listener for the "submit" event for the Join Our Program form (by clicking on the Subscribe button), prevent the default form behavior, and log the entered value to the console.
After completing the task, open a merge request from the events-task branch to the master branch.
